        Brand History
    </h2>
    <p>
        Asics (アシックス, Ashikkusu) is a Japanese multinational corporation that produces sportswear. 
        The name is an acronym for the Latin phrase anima sana in corpore sano (translated by Asics as "a sound mind,
        in a sound body"). Asics began as Onitsuka Co., Ltd on September 1, 1949. Founder Kihachiro Onitsuka 
        began manufacturing basketball shoes in his home town of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. The range of 
        sports activities serviced by the company expanded to a variety of Olympic styles used since the 1950s 
        by athletes worldwide. Onitsuka became particularly known for the Mexico 66 design, in which the distinctive 
        crossed stripes (now synonymous with the company) were featured for the first time; martial artist Bruce Lee 
        helped popularize the shoe. Onitsuka Tiger merged with fishing and sporting goods company GTO and athletic uniform 
        maker Jelenk to form Asics Corporation in 1977. Today, products manufactured and marketed by Asics include footwear 
        (sneakers, sandals), clothing (T-shirts, jackets, hoodies, swimwear, compression garments, pants, socks), and 
        accessories (bags, backpacks, caps).
