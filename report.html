    For this project, Justin Park and I created a website that offers selections of shoes that customers 
    may want to look at, along with history and descriptions for the items. 

    This project satisfies the requirements in the following list.
    1. We have a total of 5 pages. One main page that introduces the client to the page and allows them to navigate to whichever brand they wish.

    2. All pages share the same navicon which is a shoe icon to stay similar to the topic of our website. 

    3. We have a header for our pages that include all the relevant content and links to allow our pages to be styled properly.

    4. We have a navigation bar that makes it clear which pages people want to migrate to.

    5. From using the "inspect > toggle device toolbar" feature, to sliding the window size and using media queries, our pages stay properly aligned
        and change to fit screen sizes more comfortablely. 

    6. Our site includes images that show which brands we support.

    7. All our pages were validated without errors. 

    8. Two different fonts were defined in the css pages for all 5 pages to follow.
        -   Helvetica, sans-serif
        -   Georgia, sans-serif

    9. We have a feedback request form that asks for an email, name, phonenumber and custom feedback response.
        We also used a submit button that at this time does not function as we have not learned how to implement this.

    10. The 4 brand sites that we made have links that navigate to external sites.
        some examples are:
        - https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/ghost-15-womens-cushioned-running-shoe/120380.html
        - https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-cumulus/c/aa50104000/
        among others...

    Added Note:
     Our sketch was the original plan that we followed, however, as we started to work on the pages, we learned from our design and decided to follow a more simple and clean approach
     that would not confuse our client.
